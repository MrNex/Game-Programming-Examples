Description:
This is a collision test between a Circle and a oriented bounding box in 2D.
In this example, we compute the position of Circle with respect to the
bounding Box. We do this by converting the position of the circle to from the
world coordinate system to the box's model coordinate system. After doing this,
we can use the simple Circle-AABB test to check for collisions . Use mouse to
control the circle. The circle changes color upon detecting collision.
