Description:
This is an example to detect the intersection of two line segments in 2D.
You can control the two end-points of the line segment which a small part of the line, and move them using "w,a,s,d" and "i,j,k,l" respectively.
You can swap the line segment you are controlling with the space bar.
The line turns red when an intersection is detected, and is green when there is no intersection.

	//// so we offset by 4*4=16 to make sure that our first attribute is actually the position. The reason we put position after color in the struct has to do with padding.
