Description:
This is an example to detect the intersection of a line and circle in 2D.
You can control the two end-points of the line segment which a small part of the line, and move them using "w,a,s,d" and "i,j,k,l" respectively.
The line turns blue when an intersection is detected, and turns red when there is no intersection.
It checks for the point closest to the circle's center, which also lies on the line,
and checks if that point lies inside the circle. If so, collision is detected else not.
