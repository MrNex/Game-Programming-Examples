Description:
This is a collision test between two spheres in 3D. We check for collision by
comparing the distance between the centers of the two spheres and the total
sum of their radii. If the distance is greater, then the spheres are not intersecting/colliding;
otherwise they are colliding. The movable sphere changes color when a collision is detected.

Use Mouse to move in x-y plane, and "w and s" to move in z axis.
