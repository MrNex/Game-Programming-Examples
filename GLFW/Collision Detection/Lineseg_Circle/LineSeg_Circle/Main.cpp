Description:
This is an example to detect the intersection of a line segment and circle in 2D. 
You can control the two end-points of the line segment, and move them using "w,a,s,d" and "i,j,k,l" respectively.
The line turns blue when an intersection is detected, and turns red when there is no intersection.
The program first checks if either of the end-points lie within the circle (which is stationary), if so, collision is detected.
If neither of the end-points are inside the circle, then it check for the closest point to the circle's center, which also lies on the line,
and checks if that point lies inside the circle. If so, collision is detected else not.
