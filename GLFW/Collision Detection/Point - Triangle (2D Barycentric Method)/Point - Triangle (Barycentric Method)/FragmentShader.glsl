Description:
This is a demonstration of collision detection between a point and a triangle.
The demo contains a triangle. When the mouse is not detected as colliding with
the triangle, the triangle  will appear green. When the mouse is detected as colliding 
with the triangle, the triangle will become yellow. 

The triangle is able to be moved. you can translate the triangle in the XY plane with WASD.
The triangle can be rotated by with the Q and E keys. 

This algorithm tests for collisions between a point and a triangle by utilizing
a barycentric coordinate system. First, we transform the system into worldspace, then
translate the objects such that their new coordinate system has an origin on the center of the
triangle. From here we determine two scalars, t and s, which represent scales of the triangles sides
we must travel to reach the point. If 0.0f <= t + s <= 1.0f  then the point is contained
within the triangle.

This is a more mathematical approach to the solution. For a more geometric approach,
please see Point - Triangle (Normal Method).
