Description:
This is an example to detect the intersection of a line segment and circle in 3D.
This program uses seeveral techniques, and employs a series of test to ensure the collision of sphere
and triangle.
We have three separate checks in this example:
1) point-Sphere
2) line-Sphere
3) Plane sphere
This is an ineffective way to do this check, but its easier to understand.
