Description:
This is an example to detect the intersection of a line Segment and AABB in 3D.
We extend the example of a line and AABB collision in this example. If you have
not viewd Line and AABB collision before this, please go back and view that
before procceding.
In this example, along with the usual checks for the AABB and line Collision check,
we also check if the points of entry and exit lie on the line segment.

Use Mouse to move in x-y plane, and "w and s" to move in z axis.
