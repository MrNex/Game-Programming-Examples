Description:
This is a bounding circle collision test.  This is in 2D.
Contains two circles, both . They are bounded by circles, and when these circles collide they will change colors to red.
The larger circle can be moved using the arrow keys, likewise the smaller circle can be moved with WASD.
The algorithm will detect any type of collision, including containment.
The circles should be the exact same as their bounding circles, since they circles any rotation applied to the objects will not make a difference.
