Description:
This is an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box collision test. This is in 2D.
Contains two squares, one that is stationary and one that is moving. They are bounded by
AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) and when these AABBs collide, the moving object
"bounces" on the X-axis (because that is the only direction the object is moving). The
algorithm will detect collision along any axis, but will not be able to output the axis
of collision because it doesn't know. Thus, we assume X and hardcode in the X-axis bounce.
If you would like to know the axis of collision, try out the Swept AABB collision.
There is a physics timestep such that every update runs at the same delta time, regardless
of how fast or slow the computer is running. The squares should be the exact same as their
AABBs, since they are aligned on the X-Y axes but should you wish to see how the AABB
recalculates when the object's orientation changes, simply uncomment the rotate lines
(obj1->Rotate, obj2->Rotate).
