Description:
This is an example to detect the intersection of a 2D triangle and a 3D sphere in 3 Dimensions.
In this example, we find the closest point on the triangle to the center of the sphere,
and check if that point lies inside the sphere, If it intersects, then the traingle intersects with the
sphere else it does not.

To get the closest point ,we figure out on which voronoi region the center of the sphere lies on. Then we
convert that opint into baricenteric coordinate, and calculate the colest point on the triangle to the center
of the sphere. Then we check the distance between the sphere and that point.

All this is done mathematically on paper, only the main formula is encoded here. For more detail, refer to
