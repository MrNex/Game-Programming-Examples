Description:
This is a demonstration of collision detection between a point and a Sphere.
The demo contains a point and a wireframe of a sphere. When the objects are not 
colliding the sphere will appear blue and the point will appear green. When the 
two objects collide the sphere will become pink and the point will become yellow. 

Both shapes are able to be moved, you can move the selected shape in the XY plane with WASD.
You can also move the shape along the Z axis with left shift and left control. You can
swap which shape is selected with spacebar. 

This algorithm tests for collisions between a point and a sphere by determining
if the distance between the point and the sphere's center is less than
the radius of the sphere.
