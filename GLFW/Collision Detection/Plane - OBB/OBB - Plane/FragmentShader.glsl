Description:
This is a demonstration of an Oriented Bounding Box and a Plane. 
The demo contains a wireframe of a box and a solid plane. The plane is colored blue
And the box is colored green until the two collide, then the plane will change to the color
pink and the box will change to the color yellow.

Both shapes are able to be moved, you can move the selected shape in the XY plane with WASD
and along the Z axis with Left Shift & Left Control. You can also rotate the selected shape by clicking
and dragging the mouse.

This demo detects collisions by making sure all corners of the box lie on the same side of the plane.
We do this by translating the corners of the box into world space and the normal of the plane
into world space, then translating the entire system to to be centered on the origin of the plane.
From here, you are able to determine what side of the plane the corners fall on by observing the dot
product of the corner's position vectors with the plane's normal. If any sign doesn't match another,
there is a collision.
