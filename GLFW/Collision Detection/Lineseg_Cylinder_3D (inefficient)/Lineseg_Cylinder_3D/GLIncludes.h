Description:
This is a example to detect collision between a linesegnt and a cylinder.
It finds the closest points on the two lines and finds if the distance
between them is less than radius. Ifso, the ncollision is detected.
This is a inefficient test because it has a lot of edge cases, but
its easier to understand and implement.
