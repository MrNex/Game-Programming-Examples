Description:
This is a example to detect collision between a linesegnt and a cylinder. 
It finds the closest points on the two lines and finds if the distance 
between them is less than radius. Ifso, the ncollision is detected.
This is a inefficient test because it has a lot of edge cases, but
its easier to understand and implement.

	Assume that P1 and P2 are the closest points on line 1 and 2 respectively.
	So,
	P1 = L1(s) = point1 + (s* d1)
	P2 = L2(t) = point1 + (t* d2) 

	for some constant s and t.

	the vector joining P1 and P2 is v.
	thus, v(s,t) = L1(s) + L2(t)

	So,
	since v is perpendicular to both L1 and L2.
	d1.v(s,t) = 0
	d2.v(s,t) = 0

	substituting the parametric equation for v(s,t) and expanding them gives us:

	(d1.d1)s - (d1.d2)t = -(d1.r)
	and
	(d2.d1)s - (d2.d2)t = -(d2.r)

	where r = l1.point1 - l2.point1

	this can also be written as :
	
	|a -b| |s| = |-c|
	|b -c| |t|   |-f|

	where;
	a =d1.d1
	b= d1.d2
	c = d1.r
	e = d2.d2
	f = d2.r
	d = ae - b^2;

	solving this system of equation we get:
	s = (bf -ce)/d
	t = (af -bc)/d

	substituting these values in the quation gives us the closest point between two line segments. 
	We can then check if these points lie on the line segment or outside. We then compute the distance
	between these points, and if the distance is less than a specified threshold then a collision is said to have occoured.
