Description:
This is a collision detection algorithm between a line and an oriented bounding box in 2D.
By determining which side of the line the corners of the OBB fall on, we can tell if they are colliding.
If two corners fall on two different sides of the line, then the line and the box must be colliding.
We can determine which side of the line corners fall on by observing the sign of the dot product of each corner 
with the normal of the line. The objects will appear green when not colliding, and red once they are colliding.

Use WASD to move the selected shape, and Q and E to rotate the selected shape.
Spacebar will switch the selected shape.
