Description:
This example demonstrates the implementation of deferred shading
rendering technique. In this example we render two spheres.

In the first pass, we store the position, normal and diffuse color
on separate textures. This is done by attaching three separate textures
to a frame buffer object. and then rendering to the frame buffer.

In the second pass, we get the position, normal and diffuse color by
sampling the three textures, and use those to compute the final color
of that particular pixel based on lighting calculations.
