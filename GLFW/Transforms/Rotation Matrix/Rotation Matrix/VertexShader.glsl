Description:
This is a demonstration of an implementation of the Graham-Schmidt process.
The demo contains 3 axes which kept mutually perpendicular through the Graham-Schmidt
process. The red axis represents the axis which is controlled by user input.

The Graham Schmidt process is an algorithm for taking a single vector and computing
the rest of the vectors needed to span that space. It is useful for generating vectors
which represent a coordinate system of a plane.

The red axis can be rotated about the Y axis by holding the left mouse button
and moving the mouse left and right. The red axis can be rotated about the X axis
by holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse up and down.
