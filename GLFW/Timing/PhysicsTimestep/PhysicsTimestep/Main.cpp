Description:
Builds upon the FPS project to introduce the concept of using a physics timestep.
What this means is that every update will have a constant delta time that is set by
a variable. This allows for smooth animations and deterministic physics. This particular
project also implements an accumulator, which will take the delta time between the two
frames and add it to a variable. That variable is then compared to the physics timestep,
and we may end up calling the update function twice in a given frame. Even then, the
delta time for the update function will always equal the physics timestep.
