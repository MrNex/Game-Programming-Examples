Description:
This is a program that shows the difference in integration mechanisms Runge kutta and
Euler integration method. The runge kutta method is of fourth order. Euler integrator,
takes the value of the function F(x,y(x)) and integrates it over the time step T.
Unlike Euler integrator, RK integrator, divides the entire time step into 3 parts and 
averages the slope of the velocity It uses that value of the y(x) to integrate over
the entire time step T. This results in having a reduced margin of error.

You can see the error margin between the two techniques. The red line uses the RK method,
while the blue line uses euler integrator. The red line is closer to its precise implementation.

use "space" to move one time Step.
