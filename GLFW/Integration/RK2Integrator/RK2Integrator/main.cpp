Description:
This is a program that shows the difference in integration mechanisms Runge kutta and 
Euler integration method. The runge kutta method is of second order. Euler integrator,
takes the value of the function F(x,y(x)) and integrates it over the time step T.
Unlike Euler integrator, RK integrator, takes the value of the variable y(x) at the 
middle of the time step T i.e T/2. It uses that value of the y(x) to integrate over
the entire time step T. This results in having a reduced margin of error of the order of 3.

You can see the error margin between the two techniques. The red line uses the RK method, 
while the blue line uses euler integrator. The red line is closer to its precise implementation. 

use "space" to move one time Step.

		//// Stream means that the data will be modified once, and used only a few times at most. Static means that the data will be modified once, and used a lot. Dynamic means that the data

		//// The fifth parameter is a pointer to the first component of the first generic vertex attribute in the array. If a named buffer object is bound to GL_ARRAY_BUFFER (and it is, in this case)

		//// so we offset by 4*4=16 to make sure that our first attribute is actually the position. The reason we put position after color in the struct has to do with padding.
