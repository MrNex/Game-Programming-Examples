Description:
This is a demonstration of Second order Newton - Euler integration.
There is a triangle with a constant acceleration. The demo will use 
Second order Newton - Euler integration to solve for it's velocity & position each
frame. Second order Newton - Euler integration is relatively simple to implement and
has a higher stability than it's first order counterpart.

You can reset the object's velocity to 0 by pressing spacebar.

	//Second order Newton - Euler integration is still fairly simple to grasp and implement, and has much better stability than 
	//the first order equivalent! It does, however, require the use of integration.
	//We know from physics and mathematics that acceleration is the derivative of velocity, which is to say
	//	A = dV/dt
	//We also know that velocity is in fact the derivative of position:
	//	V = dX/dt
	//This means that Acceleration must in fact be the second derivative of position
	//	A = d^2X/dt^2
	//And using this fact instead of only using the first derivatives in our computation is what makes up the second order Newton - Euler integration.
	//If we consider the acceleration at time interval dt
	//	A(dt) = dV/dt
	//	dV = A * dt
	//And we know dV = V - V0, so solving for V
	//	V = V0 + A * dt
	//Now, if we want to determine the position based on both acceleration and velocity, we can integrate this equation with respect to dt
	//	X = V0*dt + (1/2) * A * dt^2 + C
	//Here the C term is very important because it in fact signifies the position of where we were before the time interval dt!
	//We can have an infinite number of "correct" answers if we do not start from the correct place.
	//This brings us to:
	//	X = X0 + V0*dt + (1/2) * A * dt^2
	//So let us now calculate our new position
	glm::vec3 v0dT = dt * triangleBody->velocity;						//Solve for the first degree term
	glm::vec3 aT2 = (0.5f) * triangleBody->acceleration * powf(dt, 2);	//Solve for the second degree term

	triangleBody->position += v0dT + aT2;								//Take sum of terms

	//It is important that after calculating our new position we determine our new velocity, and NOT before!
	//The reason being is the position equation calls for v0, the velocity at the beginning of this time interval.
	//If we solved for velocity first we would not have v0, we would have v1.
	//
	//Now we will use
	//	V = V0 + A * dt
	//to determine the new velocity
	triangleBody->velocity += dt * triangleBody->acceleration;


	//If the position goes off of the right edge of the screen, loop it back to the left
	if (triangleBody->position.x > 1.0f) triangleBody->position.x = -1.0f;
