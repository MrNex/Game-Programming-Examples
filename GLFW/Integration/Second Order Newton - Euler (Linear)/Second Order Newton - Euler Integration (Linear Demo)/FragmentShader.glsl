Description:
This is a demonstration of Second order Newton - Euler integration.
There is a triangle with a constant acceleration. The demo will use 
Second order Newton - Euler integration to solve for it's velocity & position each
frame. Second order Newton - Euler integration is relatively simple to implement and
has a higher stability than it's first order counterpart.

You can reset the object's velocity to 0 by pressing spacebar.
