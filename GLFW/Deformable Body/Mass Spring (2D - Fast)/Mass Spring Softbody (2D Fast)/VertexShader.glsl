Description:
This is a demonstration of using mass spring systems to simulate soft body physics.
The demo contains a blue cloth made of a 50x50 grid of masses with springs connecting them.

Each physics timestep the mass spring system is solved to determine the force on each
individual point mass in the system. This is done using Hooke's law. The springs also contain 
dampening forces to help relax the system upon purterbation.

The user can apply forces to the bottom edge of the cloth.
Hold the left mouse button to apply a force along the positive X axis.
Hold the right mouse button to apply a force along the negative X axis.
Hold Left shift to switch the axis to the Y axis.

It should be noted that this is a more complex example focused on increasing the speed of 
the iterative algorithm. For a straight forward demonstation see the Mass Spring (2D) example.
