Description:
This is a demonstration of using mass spring systems to simulate soft body physics.
The demo contains a blue cloth made of a 10x10 grid of masses with springs connecting them.

Each physics timestep the mass spring system is solved to determine the force on each
individual point mass in the system. This is done using Hooke's law. The springs also contain 
dampening forces to help relax the system upon purterbation.

The user can apply forces to the bottom edge of the cloth.
Hold the left mouse button to apply a force along the positive X axis.
Hold the right mouse button to apply a force along the negative X axis.
Hold Left shift to switch the axis to the Y axis.

It should be noted that this is a straightforward example without attempts to optimize.
It is best if an algorithm like this is done on the GPU, however even on the CPU this
is a very inefficient way to implement the algorithm. Please see the "Mass Spring Softbody (2D Fast)"
example for some tips on speeding this up even when running on the CPU.
