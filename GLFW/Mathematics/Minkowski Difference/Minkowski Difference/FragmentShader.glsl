Description:
This is a demonstration of implementing an algorithm known as Jarvis March.
The Jarvis March algorithm is a popular & simple method of computing the
smallest convex hull which contains a set of points in 2D.

The Jarvis March algorithm works by first finding the left-most
point in the set. Then, it tests all edges to find the counter-clockwise
most one. This continues until it wraps around to the starting edge again.
