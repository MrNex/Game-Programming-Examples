Description:
This is a demonstration of detecting the collision point between two colliding circles in 2D.
There are Pink and Yellow wireframes of circles. When the circles collide the collision point
is calculated and marked with a white box on the screen. 

After the two circles have been decoupled, the collision point of two circles can be found trivially.
The point is found by travelling a distance of a circles radius along the minimum translation vector.

The user can move a circle using WASD.
The user can also press spacebar to toggle the circle he/she is moving.
