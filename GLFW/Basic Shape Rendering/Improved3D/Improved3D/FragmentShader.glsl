Description:
Builds upon the "Standard3D" project and renders a 3D cube, spinning about the 
X-Y axis. This uses a uniform Model-View-Projection matrix which allows us to 
change the perspective of the camera. It also contains an element buffer which 
is used to read from the vertex buffer. This project is more about getting 
started and understanding what a basic OpenGL program looks like.
