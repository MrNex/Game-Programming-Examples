Description:
This is a demonstration of calculating and applying form drag. The demo contains a yellow triangle. 
The triangle has a constant force being applied to it and will continue to accelerate.
Because of drag, the triangle will eventually hit its terminal velocity and stabilize at a constant velocity.

The algorithm Calculates & applies approximate drag due to an object's form. This is done through
the use of the Drag Equation discovered by Lord Rayleigh. This takes into account various
physical attributes such as a Drag Coefficient, cross-sectional length, the density of the medium,
and the relative velocity between the medium and the object. This formula is only accurate under certain conditions:
	Objects must have a blunt form factor
	The medium/fluid must have a reynolds number >= 1.
