Description:
This is a demonstration of forces. It uses forces to simulate spring mechanics with damping.
There is a triangle which will have a spring force pulling it to the mouse position. The demo will use 
second order Newton - Euler integration to solve for it's and it's linear velocity & position each frame.

The demo does this by using Hooke's Law,
F = -k * (X - O) - c * V

You can reset an object's position and velocity by pressing Spacebar.
