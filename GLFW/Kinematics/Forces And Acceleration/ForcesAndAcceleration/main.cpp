Description:
This is an example to demonstrate how forces and acceleration are 
implemented in code. 
For any object to be affected by forces, it needs to
possess mass as a basic attribute. Force acts on the mass, and the 
resultant is also acceleration. Acceleration can be computed from 
force using the following formula : 
			Acceleration = Force/Mass
Any object can be accelerated to reach a certain velocity. Multiplying 
acceleration with the time duration give us the change in velocity the
object undergoes in that duration of time. Adding this value to the 
current velocity will give us the current velocity, from whic hwe can
derive the displacement.
