Description:
This is a program showing the implementation of the bouyant force in fluids.
This example has a sphere which represents the mass, and the fluid is represented
by the blue box. The parameters for the fluid like density, and the parameters for
the ball, like mass and size can be changed from the first code block.

Buoyancy is the property of fluid to extert force on an object when submerged in the fuid.
This force is equal to the weight of water displaced by the object. The mass of the water
displaced can be computed by the volume of the fluid displaced multiplied by the density
of the fluid. The "weight" can be computed by multiplying the mass and gravity. This gives
us the magnitude of the buoyant force acting on the object(ball).

Buoyant force always acts in the direction opposite to gravity. So, multiplying the magnitude
with the unit vector against the gravitional force gives us the buoyant force.
Adding this force to the all the other forces acting on the body (in this case gravitational pull)
gives us the behaviour we expect.
