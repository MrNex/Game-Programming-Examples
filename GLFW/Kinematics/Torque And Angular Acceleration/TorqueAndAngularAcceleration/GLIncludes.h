Description:
This is an example to demonstrate how torques and acceleration are
implemented in code.
Torque is a force which is perpendicular the line joining the point of contact
and the center of mass. This acts on the center of mass, and the resultant is
angular acceleration. Angular acceleration can be computed from torque using
the following formula :
Angular Acceleration = Torque/Moment of Inertia
Multiplying the angular acceleration with the time duration give us the change
in angular velocity the object undergoes in that duration of time. Adding this value to the
current angular velocity will give us the current angular velocity , from which
we can derive the displacement.
It is similar to linear kinematics, but the difference is instead of using mass,
we use moment of inertia, which is variable based on the axis of rotation and the
distance of the torque from the center of mass.

Since this program employs euler angles, it also suffers from gimbal lock.
For more information on the solving gimbal lock, refer to the examples using quaternions.
