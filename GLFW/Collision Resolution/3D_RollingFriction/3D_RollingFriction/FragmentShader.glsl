Description:
This program demonstrates how an object starts rolling due to the 
frictional forces is expereinces during linear motion. The linear motion
triggers a frictional impulse at the point of contact. This frictional
impulse affects the linear velocity and produces a torque.

Building upon the previous example of angular motion, we simple use 
the linear frictional impulse and apply it to the object as a toruqe.
This induces rotation in a non rotating body.
