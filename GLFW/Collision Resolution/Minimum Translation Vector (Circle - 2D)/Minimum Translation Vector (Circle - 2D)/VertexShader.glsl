Description:
This is a demonstration of detecting the minimum translation vector of two circles in 2D.
There are Pink and Yellow wireframes of circles, when the circles overlap, the MVP will be
drawn over the overlap distance indicating the intersection direction & magnitude between the two circles.

The algorithm used is a modified version of the Separating Axis Theorem which is made much faster and more
trivial because of both objects being circles. The only possible axis for intersection is
the vector from the center of one circle to the other. Overlap over this axis is tested,
if overlap is found, the axis is normalized to get the minimum translation vector. the amount of overlap
is saved as the magnitude of the intersection.

The user can move a circle using WASD.
The user can also press spacebar to toggle the circle he/she is moving.
