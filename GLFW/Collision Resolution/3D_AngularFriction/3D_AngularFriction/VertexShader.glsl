Description:
This program demonstrates the implementation of angular friction in games. 
It builds upon the previous example of "3D Friction". We use the same concept 
as linear friction to caluculate the forces at the point of contact along 
the axis of spin. 

Then we use the same concept as in the Linear friction, and calculate the 
fritional force. In this model, the force is computed as an impulse acting
at the point of contact.

Use "Space" to reset the simulation and "W" to add angular velocity the box.
