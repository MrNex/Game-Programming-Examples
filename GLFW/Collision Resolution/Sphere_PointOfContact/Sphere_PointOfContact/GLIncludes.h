Description:
This example build upon the previous example of deriving the MTV for colision
between two spheres and decoupling them (3D Sphere collision with MTV derivation
and decoupling). This example demonstrates deriving the point of collision from
the MTV after decoupling the spheres.

Once the two spheres have been moved in such a way that they are now in justcontact with each other,
then the point of contact is at a distance of radius from the center of A in the direction pointed by MTV.

In this program, the point of contact will blink as soon as the collision occours.

use " W, A, S, D " to rotate the sphere. This should have no effect on the algorithm as all poitns
are equidistant from the center. Use " U, O, I, K, J ,L " to move the sphre in Z, Y and X plane respectively.
Use Space to switch between the two spheres.
