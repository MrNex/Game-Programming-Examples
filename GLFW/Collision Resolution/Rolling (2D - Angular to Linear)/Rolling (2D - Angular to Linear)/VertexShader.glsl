Description:
This is a demonstration of calculating and applying a linear frictional force to colliding rigidbodies in
such a way that rolling can be facilitated. The demo contains a yellow circle & a pink rectangle. The pink rectangle is
supposed to be the ground, which in turn has infinite mass. The demo uses the Coulomb Impulse-Based model of friction to
simulate frictional forces between colliding bodies.

The algorithm Calculates & applies a linear frictional impulse according to Coulomb's impulse based model of friction.
This includes calculations of the linear velocity at the point of collision due to angular motion of an object to facilitate a rolling motion.
This algorithm only takes into account translating angular momentum to linear momentum, not the other way around.
I.E.: A Spinning block will begin to roll (translationally slide) while a sliding block will not begin to spin.
