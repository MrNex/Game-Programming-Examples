Description:
This is a demonstration of collision resolution between 3D convex hulls.
The process of collision resolution includes, detecting collision, deducing
the point of collision and then resolving the collision.
To resolve collision, we use an impulse based collision resolution formula.
We calculate the impulse at the point of contact. Then the component of impulse
is added to the linear velocity and the torque is computed from the impulse
generating at the point of contact and added to the current angular velocity.
