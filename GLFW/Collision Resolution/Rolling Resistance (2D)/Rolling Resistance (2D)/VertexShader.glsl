Description:
This is a demonstration of calculating and applying a rolling resistance angular impulse. The demo contains a yellow wireframe of
a circle and a pink ground. The ground has infinite mass and cannot be moved, while the yellow circle is subject to
various impulses and forces.

The algorithm Calculates & applies an angular impulse to inhibit rolling motion. This is done based on a coefficient of rolling resistance
given by design & the mass aswell as radius of the body. First a rolling resistance force is calculated, this is then translated to a torque.
Because we have already defined rolling mechanics, the torque applied which will inhibit angular motion will also slow the
linear velocity of a rolling object.

The user can press and hold the spacebar to apply a constant linear force at the yellow circles center of mass.
