Description:
This is a demonstration of detecting the point of collision between convex polygons in 2D.
Detecting the point of collision occurs after intersecting objects have registered in a collision
and have been separated to no longer be intersecting (decoupled). When the polygons are colliding
a red dot will appear at the point of collision.

After determining the minimum translation vector and decoupling the objects, we can determine the set
of points on each object which are most in the direction of the other object along the axis made by the
Minimum Translation Vector.

You can move the polygons using WASD, and rotate them using Q and E.
You can switch which polygon you are controlling using Spacebar.

//Performs the separating axis test in 2D to see if two convex hulls are colliding,
//and tracks the direction of least separation.
//
//Overview:
//	This algorithm works by creating a single dimensional axis from each edge normal belonging to both polygons.
//	Each axis represents a direction away from the edge it belongs to.
//	By taking the scalar projection of a point onto an axis we can see how close that point lies away from the edge if it were to extend outward in every direction.
//	If we keep track of the maximum and minimum measurements of these scalar projections, we can see the boundary of a polygon on these axes.
//	By comparing the boundaries of the polygons on each axis we can determine which axes the polygons overlap on,
//	and if they overlap on every axis, we must have a collision.
//
//PArameters:
//	hull1: The first convex hull being tested for a collision
//	position1: The position of the first convex hull
//	hull2: The second convex hull being tested for a collision
//	position2: The position of the second convex hull

	for (int i = 0; i < numPoints2; i++)
	{
		worldPoints2.push_back(position2 + hull2.rotation * hull2.points[i]);
	}

	//Next we must get the rotated normals of each hull

		//The projection formula can be given as follows:
		//	Proj(x, y) = ((x . y) / (y . y)) * y
		//where "Proj(x, y)" denotes the projection of the vector x onto the vector y, and " . " denotes the dot product.
		//We can simplify this because our normal (y in the above example) is normalized. A vector dotted with itself is equal to the magnitude squared:
		//	Proj(x, y) = ((x . y)/1) * y
		//	Proj(x, y) = (x . y) * y

		//Finally, we can simplify this one step further. Because we do not care for a vector representing the projection, but rather a means of
		//comparing (not correctly quantifying) distances in a direction, we can assume that if (x . y) is a larger value than (q . y), (x . y) * y must also be larger
		//than (q . y) * y. So by using the dot product of each point, x, with each normal, y, we can effectively get a scalar representation of how far x is in the direction
		//Of y, and therefore how far x is away from the edge.

		//While this value is not the real distance, we can compare the maximum and minimum values found from each point set and check if they overlap
