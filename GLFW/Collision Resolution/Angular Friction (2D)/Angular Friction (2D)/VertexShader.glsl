Description:
This is a demonstration of calculating and applying an angular frictional force to rigidbodies in
such a way that a rotation which is around an axis perpendicular to a surface can be diminished through friction. 
The demo contains a yellow circle which is supposed to be laying flat on the ground. The demo uses a modified version 
of the Coulomb Impulse-Based model of friction to simulate frictional forces between colliding bodies.

The algorithm Calculates & applies an angular frictional impulse similat to Coulomb's impulse based model of friction
however it has been adopted for angular friction. The algorithm calculates the friction due to flat-spin on a surface.
Because there is only one degree of angular freedom in a 2D game, we assume that the body is resting on another object and the surface
normal is in the Z direction.
