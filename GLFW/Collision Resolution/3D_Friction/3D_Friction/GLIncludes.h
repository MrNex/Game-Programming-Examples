Description:
This program demonstrates the implementation of friction in games.
This is built upon the previous example of "3D Convex Hull collision
resolution".
We use coulomb's impulse based frition model to implement friction.
The advantage of this model, is that the frictional force is added as
an impulse rather than force. This impulse can be added during the
collision resolution phase.

The friction is applied at the point of contact and is calculated as
follows:
If the object is not currently in motion parrallely to the object,
then the object does not experience static friction, it experiences
dynamic friction,(no matter the relative velocity). If the tangential
force is less than or equal to the normal (reactive) force, then the
object expereinces a static friction equal tothe force applied and
does not move.
