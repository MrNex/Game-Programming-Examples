Description:
This project does the same thing as the previous Text Shaders example, only 
it puts the shaders into actual .glsl files. The shader code is otherwise 
exactly the same, having hard-coded vertices and color. Two functions, 
readShader and createShader, are used to compile the shaders from the .glsl 
files. This simply renders a green triangle on a red background.

	// File streams contain two member functions for reading and writing binary data (read, write). The read function belongs to ifstream, and the write function belongs to ofstream.
