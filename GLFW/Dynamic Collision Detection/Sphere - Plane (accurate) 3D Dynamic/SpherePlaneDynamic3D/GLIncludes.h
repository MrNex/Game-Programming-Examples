Description:
This is an emaple showing how to detect collision between moving objects.
This is demo detects collision between a moving sphere and a plane. This demo
calculates the point of collision along with the exact time of collision.
It finds the colest point on teh sphere and projects it along the velocity
of the sphere to find the point and time of contact. If the time lies within
0 to 1, the collision occours withing the next time step.

Use "SPACE" to move ahead my 1 timestep. Use mouse "click and drag" to rotate
the plane.
