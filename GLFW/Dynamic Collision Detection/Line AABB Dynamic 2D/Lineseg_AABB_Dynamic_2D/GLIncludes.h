Description:
This example demonstrates the collision between a stationary line and a
axis aligned bounding box. We use the same approach we used in determining
the collision between a line and an AABB.
First we find out if the rectangle before and after the collision lies
completly on one side of the line.
second, we check if both the before and after timeStep the box lies on the
same Side of the triangle. If it does, then it is not colliding.

We determine the relative position of the rectangle with respect to line,
using dot products of the 4 points to the normal of the line. If all the dot
products are of same sign then, then all 4 points lie on the same side.

Use "left Shift" to toggle the intergration mode from automatic to manual.
Use "space" to move ahead by 1 timestep.
