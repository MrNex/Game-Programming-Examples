Description:
This example demonstrates the dynamic collision detection between a circle
and a axis aligned bounding box. This test is composed of three tests. First,
to check if the starting point is colliding with the rectangle. Second, Check
if the end state is colliding with the rectangle.Now that we know that the start
and the end state don't collide, then we can presumme that the collision is
occuring along the path if occuring at all. We take the path of the circle (relative
to the the box) and find the path followed by the end points on the circle which are
prependicular to the the movement. Following these poitns we, get two lines. If any
of these lines intersect with the box, then the circle will collide in the next timestep.

use "w,a,s and d " to move the circle. Consider each movement to be done in one timestep.
If the program detects a collision will occur in the next timestep, then it wont move the circle.
