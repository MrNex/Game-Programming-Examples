Description:
This example demonstrates the detection of collision between a moving 
sphere and a line segment.
We take the current position of the sphere and the position of the sphere 
after the timestep. Consider these positions as the two end points of a line segment.
Now find the closest points on these line segments to each other. Check if these
points are closer thanthe radius of the sphere. If they are, they they collide
during that timestep else they don't.

Use "left Shift" to toggle the intergration mode from automatic to manual. 
Use "space" to move ahead by 1 timestep.
