## [https://github.com/MrNex/NGen (NGen)]
The NGen is an open source game engine available for both Windows and Linux. Written in C99, the engine allows for the rapid prototyping of complex 3D games and simulations through code. It features it's own physics engine and linear algebra libraries, and focuses on openness, allowing a developer to grab and manipulate any underlying structure the NGen uses to run. The author of the NGen is Nicholas Gallagher (Contributions encouraged).
