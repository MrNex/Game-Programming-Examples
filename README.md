# Game-Programming-Examples
A comprehensive library of a multitude of game programming topics with robust examples.
## Install Instructions
1. Download / clone the repository and unzip if necessary.
2. Copy the Debug directory in the top level directory:

      ```
            /Game-Programming-Examples/Debug
      ```
      
3. Paste the copied debug directory to the *solution directory* of the example you would like to run. For example, consider you wanted to run the Convex Hull (SAT - 3D) example, you would paste the directory in:

      ```
            /Game-Programming-Examples/GLFW/Collision Detection/Convex Hull (SAT - 3D)/
      ```
      
4. Run the solution file (.sln) of the example you wish to run from the aforementioned *solution directory*. For our previous example:

      ```
            /Game-Programming-Examples/GLFW/Collision Detection/Convex Hull (SAT - 3D)/Convex Hull (SAT - 3D).sln
      ```
      
**Note:** *Each example will have controls printed in the command prompt / terminal window upon being executed.*

**Also Note:** *Some examples will not work in Visual Studio 2012 due to the compiler not supporting [Initializer Lists](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh567368(v=vs.120).aspx).*
