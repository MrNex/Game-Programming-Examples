# Game-Programming-Examples
A comprehensive library of a multitude of game programming topics with robust examples.
## Instructions
1. Download / clone the repository and unzip if necessary.
      
2. Navigate to the directory of the example which you would like to run.
      
3. Double click the solution file (\*.sln) of the example you wish to run.

**Note:** *Each example will have controls printed in the command prompt / terminal window upon being executed.*

**Also Note:** *Some examples will not work in Visual Studio 2012 due to the compiler not supporting [Initializer Lists](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh567368(v=vs.120).aspx).*

**Final Note:** *Examples are not currently Visual Studio 2015 compatible, however they can be compiled and ran in Visual Studio 2015 if the user re-compiles the GLFW library from  the source code in Visual Studio 2015.*
