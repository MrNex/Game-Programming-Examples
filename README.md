# Game-Programming-Examples
A comprehensive library of a multitude of game programming topics with robust examples.
## Install Instructions
1. Download / clone the repository and unzip if necessary.
2. Copy the include and lib directories in the top level directory:

      ```
            /Game-Programming-Examples/include
            /Game-Programming-Examples/lib
      ```
      
3. Paste the copied include and lib directories into the *project directory* of the example you would like to run. For example, consider you wanted to run the Convex Hull (SAT - 3D) example, you would paste the directories in:

      ```
            /Game-Programming-Examples/GLFW/Collision Detection/Convex Hull (SAT - 3D)/Convex Hull (SAT - 3D)/
      ```
      
4. Copy the Debug directory in the top level directory:
      ```
            /Game-Programming-Examples/Debug
      ```
5. Paste the copied debug directory to the *solution directory* of the example you would like to run. For example, consider you wanted to run the Convex Hull (SAT - 3D) example, you would paste the directory in:
      ```
            /Game-Programming-Examples/GLFW/Collision Detection/Convex Hull (SAT - 3D)/
      ```
6. Run the solution file (.sln) of the example you wish to run. For our previous example:
      ```
            /Game-Programming-Examples/GLFW/Collision Detection/Convex Hull (SAT - 3D)/Convex Hull (SAT - 3D).sln
      ```
